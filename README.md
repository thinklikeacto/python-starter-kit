# 🧱 Python Microservice Starter Kit

A modular, scalable, and production-ready boilerplate to kickstart any Python-based microservice.

This starter kit follows clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns across layers like API, services, repositories, and models. It is designed to work with multiple databases (SQL or NoSQL), supports versioned APIs, and is easy to extend for any business use case. Ideal for teams looking to build r

## 📁 Folder Structure & Purpose

### `app/api/`
- Organizes API interfaces
- Uses routers (e.g., FastAPI `APIRouter`)
- Handles versioning for long-term maintainability
- `schemas/` includes request and response models with validation

### `app/core/`
- Central place for all configurations, logging, and global exceptions
- Reads from `.env` or config file using Pydantic or Dynaconf

### `app/services/`
- Contains business logic that interacts with repositories
- Keeps logic separate from database implementation

### `app/models/`
- ORM models (SQLAlchemy, Tortoise ORM, Pydantic) representing DB tables or domain entities

### `app/repository/`
- Implements all interactions with databases
- One repository per model (CRUD + custom queries)

### `app/utils/`
- Reusable utility code (token generation, encryption, email sending, etc.)

### `db/`
- Manages schema migrations (e.g., Alembic)
- Can include initial seed data or dummy datasets

### `tests/`
- Includes `unit/` tests (mocked DB or services) and `integration/` tests (actual app context)
- Uses Pytest with fixtures for setup

### `scripts/`
- Shell/Python scripts for automation
- Used for setup, migration, formatting, linting, and cleanup tasks
